# YOU WASTE YOUR TIME


## This is a useless website full of time eating stuff to explore

## Little games, easter egss and things to explore, should give you a break from work, overthinking or just a break at all. Maybe you can call ot digital meditation.

## This is a project from Mia Vogl & Ch√©rise Barthel
